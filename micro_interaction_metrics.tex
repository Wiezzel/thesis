& Average \emph{degree of interest}\footnote{\emph{Degree of interest} (DOI) is a parameter increasing on programmer's interactions and decreasing with time, thus measuring the interest in a particular file or code element. It was introduced by Kersten \& Murhpy in \cite{mylar} together with an implementation named \textsc{Mylar}.} for the file\\
