\begin{abstract}
Detection of software defects has become one of the major challenges in the field of automated software engineering. Numerous studies have revealed that mining data from repositories could provide a substantial basis for defect prediction. In this thesis I introduce my approach towards this problem relying on the analysis of source code history and machine learning algorithms. I describe in detail the proposed computational procedures and explain their underlying assumptions. Following the theoretical basis, I  present the results of performed experiments which serve as an empirical assessment of the effectiveness of my methods.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Topic Choice Rationale}
[\textit{In this section I will present reasons for exploring the topic of bug prediction and argue for the practical value of such research.}]

Ever since the legendary first bug in 1947\footnote{According to \cite{first_bug} on 9th of September, 1947 an investigation of malfunctioning Harvard University Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator revealed a moth trapped between the points of relay \#70 in panel F. This event was reported in a log with the following statement: \textit{"First actual case of bug being found."}}, the detection of software faults has been a crucial part of the quality assurance process. Undiscovered bugs were the cause of many misfortunes with the crash of the \$500-million space rocket Ariane 5 being the most spectacular example.\footnote{On 4th of June, 1996 the rocket was launched by the European Space Agency from Kourou in French Guyana. It exploded only about 40 seconds after take-off due an error in the inertial reference system -- conversion of a 64-bit float to a 16-bit signed integer failed, because the number was larger than the largest storable value. \cite{ariane}}
