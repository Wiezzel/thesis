\midrule
\multirow{6}{*}{\cpbox{5cm}{Method/ \\ function}}
& Number of parameters & \cite{method-level} \\
& Number of local variables & \cite{method-level} \\
& Maximum depth of nested control sequences & \cite{method-level, how_and_why} \\
& Number of possible paths in the method body & \cite{method-level, how_and_why} \\
& Number of methods referenced by a given method & \cite{method-level, how_and_why} \\
& Number of methods referencing a given method & \cite{method-level, how_and_why} \\
\midrule
\multirow{9}{*}{Class}
& Number of attributes & \cite{systematic} \\
& Number of methods & \cite{systematic, micro_interaction} \\
& Number of implemented interfaces & \cite{systematic} \\
& Number of imported packages & \cite{systematic} \\

& Number of superclasses & \cite{systematic, how_and_why} \\
& Depth of inheritance tree & \cite{micro_interaction, how_and_why} \\
& Lack of cohesion of methods\footnote{LCOM = $ max\left(|P| - |Q|, 0\right) $, where $P$ is the set of all pairs of methods which do not share any fields and $Q$ is the set of all pairs of methods sharing least one field \cite[p. 488]{metrics_suite}.} & \cite{systematic, micro_interaction, how_and_why} \\
& Message passing coupling\footnote{``The MPC measures the number of method calls defined in methods of a class to methods in other classes, and therefore the dependency of local methods to methods implemented by other classes" \cite{MPC}.} & \cite{systematic} \\
\midrule
\multirow{5}{*}{Universal}
& Lines of code & \cite{systematic, micro_interaction, how_and_why} \\
& Number of statements & \cite{systematic, method-level, micro_interaction, how_and_why} \\
& Ratio of comments to source code & \cite{method-level, how_and_why} \\
& McCabe cyclomatic complexity\footnote{CC = $ E - N + P $, where $E$ is the number of edges in a \emph{program control graph}, $N$ is the number of nodes and $P$ is the number of connected components \cite{McCabe}.} & \cite{systematic, method-level, how_and_why} \\
& Halstead effort\footnote{It is ``the \emph{total number of elementary mental discriminations} required to generate a given program", which can be described by the following equation: $E = V^2/V^*$, where $V$ is the program volume and $V^*$ is the minimal possible program volume \cite[p. 47]{Halstead}.} & \cite{systematic} \\
