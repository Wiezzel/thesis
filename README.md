### Abstract

Detection of software defects has become one of the major challenges in the field of automated software engineering. Numerous studies have revealed that mining data from repositories could provide a substantial basis for defect prediction. In this thesis I introduce my approach towards this problem relying on the analysis of source code history and machine learning algorithms. I describe in detail the proposed computational procedures and explain their underlying assumptions. Following the theoretical basis, I  present the results of performed experiments which serve as an empirical assessment of the effectiveness of my methods.
